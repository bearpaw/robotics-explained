Hi, I'm Annika. I am a robotiscist and software engineer with several years of experience in intuitive robot programming and robotics control and motion planning. On this site, I explain some core robotics concepts. Even though I try to explain things as simple as possible, mathematics and especially linear algebra is the language of robotics. If you have questions or feedback, don't hesitate to contact me
